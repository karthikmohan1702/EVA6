### Assignment Details

### 1. Back Propagation:
- Rewrite the whole excel sheet showing backpropagation. Explain each major step, and write it on Github. 
- Use [0.3, 0.5, -0.2, 0.7, 0.1, -0.6, 0.3, -0.9] for [w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, w7, w8] variables instead of the other variables used in the class 
- Take a screenshot, and show that screenshot in the readme file
- Excel file must be there for us to cross-check the image shown on readme (no image = no score)
- Explain each major step
- Show what happens to the error graph when you change the learning rate from [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0]


### 2. Architectural basics:
- 99.4% validation accuracy
- Have used parameters exactly between 12000 to 18000 
- Have used exactly 19 epochs
- Have used BN, Dropout, a Fully connected layer, have used GAP. 
- Dropout must have 0.069 as the dropout value
- Batch size must be exactly 128
- Must add random rotation to your images between -5 to +5 degrees
