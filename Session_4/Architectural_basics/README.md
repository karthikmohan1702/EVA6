## Objective:
To write a MNIST recognition neural network model considering the below rules:
- 99.4% validation accuracy
- Have used parameters exactly between 12000 to 18000
- Have used exactly 19 epochs
- Have used BN, Dropout, a Fully connected layer, have used GAP.
- Dropout must have 0.069 as the dropout value
- Batch size must be exactly 128
- Must add random rotation to your images between -5 to +5 degrees


## Network Architecture & Params:
