## Objective

This assignment objective was to achieve test accuracy as 99.4% consistently in the last 4-5 epochs, with less than 10k params & under 15 epochs. It was said, to mention it in 4 steps(or models). 4 jupyter files are placed and the 4 steps are explained below along with their Receptive field.

1_Setup_&_Basic_Skeleton
-----------------------------
    Target
    ======
    1) Setting up a basic skeleton of the model
    2) Setting transforms, dataloads & training & test loops
    3) Set it as working code.

    Results
    ======
    1) Parameters: 2,02,724
    2) Best Train Accuracy: 99.49
    3) Best Test Accuracy: 99.14
    
    Analysis
    ========
    1. Huge model with overload of params
    2. Can see the model is overfitting
    3. Training is working fine & can see consistent increase in the training accuracy as we progress through epochs
    4. Will need to make the model lighter in the next step.

2_Lighter_model_&_batch_norm
----------------------------

    Target
    ======
    1) Make the model lighter (by reducing the channels)
    2) Adding batch norm to the model to increase the model efficiency

    Results
    ======
    1) Parameters: 11,364
    2) Best Train Accuracy: 99.76
    3) Best Test Accuracy: 99.30

    Analysis
    ========
    1) Before applying Batch norm - Made the model lighter by reducing channels but accuracy was dropped for 
       both the train & test due to less number of parameters. And also can see no overfitting. 
       The train_acc = 98.89 & test_acc = 98.91, gap seems to be less between them.
    2) After adding Batch norm â€“ Could see a significant increase in both the accuracies test & train. 
       This tells how much powerful batch norm is & now it has accentuated the features by uplifting them.
       The train_acc = 99.76 & test_acc = 99.30. Seems to be large gap between train & test accuracy which states 
       the model is overfitting & in the next steps we can use regularization to penalize.
